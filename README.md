# Speech Analysis

This project demonstrates a live speech analysis web application that combines facial expression recognition and speech analysis to calculate confidence scores in real-time.

## Introduction

The web application uses computer vision techniques to detect faces in a live video stream, recognize facial expressions, transcribe speech to text, and analyze the speech content. The confidence scores are calculated based on the integration of facial expression recognition and speech analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Transformers library from Hugging Face
- DeepFace library for facial expression recognition

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-speech-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the necessary pre-trained models for DeepFace and Transformers.


## Sample Usage

```python
# Sample usage
video_path = "path/to/video/file.mp4"
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)

# Initialize variables for storing confidence scores
confidence_scores = []

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Steps 1-5: Face Detection, Facial Expression Recognition, Speech Transcription,
    # Speech Analysis, and Confidence Score Calculation

# Step 6: Report Generation
generate_report(confidence_scores)

# Release video capture object
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
